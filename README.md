# Spam-Detection
Introduction:
Nowadays, it is a very relevant problem of spamming. People are becoming the victims of such malware easily, through email. Spamming, as a problem, is not only annoying, but might be dangerous.This trouble starts from frequent mail sendings and fake threats from random users. After this, messages could be more dangerous and have malware that invades users' computers and starts to spread viruses or Trojans.

Data and Methods:
Data and datasets that were involved in the project are randomly generated scenarios of two types of messages normal( safe ) or spam( dangerous). This dataset originally was uploaded from YouTube and by using Internet searches I can model the code.

Results:
Results are satisfactory, if you input a sentence of normal or spam, the program will give the responsive answer. Among 5572 lines and 2 columns 13.41% of sentences are spam. To test programs’ functionality I chose one normal message and spam message, results you can see in the screenshots below:


Discussion:
With high accuracy and change availability, Spam Detector is pretty useful in detecting messages with “spam” tags. What about results? For the beginning of Machine Learning and NLP education it’s good enough to have such achievements. As the next plans, spam detector will try to detect spam in the REAL email contents.
Resources used in project:
YouTube:
	Especially, next three videos helped me to organize it:

StackOverflow;
When I worked with code, there were mistakes that instantly could have solutions. StackOverflow was preferred;
Materials of the lectures;
Lectures of the course was very helpful to understand the meaning of project;
Kaggle.com;
	I also tried to find datasets for project here, fortunately they were similar.
